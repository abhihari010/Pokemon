For this project I recreated the well known game called Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

I utilized an 8 by 8 grid that is visible in the console when running the game to hold both the players and the CPU's pokemon.
The implementation of the CPU and its capabilities were coded by detecting nearby enemies and making decisions based on its Pokemon's position on the board.

To play the game you can copy the code and run it in any IDE you would like and it will display on the console. You will first be prompted with what Pokemon
you would like to play with, and after choosing, get to playing!!
